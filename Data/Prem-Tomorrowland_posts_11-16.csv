Tomorrowland and it's bass line-up,"So obviously Tomorrowland has always had a great variation in line-up. Techno, EDM, House, Hardstyle/core, DnB, Dubstep etc.. but I'm a big basshead and I'm spoiled with the line-ups from festivals like EDC, Ultra, HARD, Red Rocks etc.. I know Tomorrowland has a harder time with bass being in Europa but I hope they stay on top of things. Would love to see Monstercat back, Maybe another great bass hosting. Artists like REZZ, Excision, Illenium, Apashe, NGHTMRE, JAUZ etc have to be there. 

I'm curious though what kind of hosts and Artists other people would like to see on more European festivals like Tomorrowland.",Tomorrowland,1637002849

Looking for information about TML ATW,"Hi everyone, 

For a school project, we are doing research about online festivals and the difference with offline festivals. Our focus is on TML ATW!

We are really curious about the experiences of people who attended TML ATW :)

Some questions that can be answered, allowing us to answer our research question (An overall experience apart from the questions can also be very helpful!): 

1. Have you ever attended the offline (real) version of Tomorrowland? If yes, what is the big difference with the online version? If no, what was the reason that you never visited the offline festival?
2. How did you watched TML ATW? On your own or with other people? If you watched it with other people, who were these people? Friends, family etc? 
3. For the people who went to the offline version of TML: Are the people you watched the online       festival with also the same people you go to the real festival with? If no, what was the difference then? 
4. Was there a possibility to meet new people at TML ATW? If yes, how did that work? 
5. Have you decorated the room to make it look like a real festival? If so, what kind of decoration? And did this decoration really make you feel like you were at a TML?
6. What do you think about the possibility of many more people being able to attend TML through an online stream? Is this something positive or something negative? 

Any other remarks are also very helpful! 

Thank you very much in advance!!!",Tomorrowland,1634218317

2 Questions about Tomorrowland Winter,"1. The comfort package includes ""bottle service,"" how is this done? Besides that, is it possible/good idea to get a table at one of the smaller stages like Garden? And what will this cost? I can't find any details online.
2. Is it viable to stay in an airbnb? I believe the whole resort is rented out by the festival, but will independently owned homes/condos be available? Any issues that come from getting an airbnb instead of lodging through TLW?

Tomorrowland Winter 2022: Flight Packages Sold Out??,"I am not sure if I want to do the 7 or 4 days package, so I have been holding off on buying it. Anyways, I was looking at the website/simulator and saw that for 7 days the travel by plane option is sold out (?). I  would prefer to do the plane package as I am coming from the US, so does anyone know if they will be available for the 4-days or if they will add more flights to the 7-days one?    


Also (if you have been) would you recommend doing the 7 days package? I am afraid that I won't get to explore the entire site/do everything they have to offer in just 4 days. I might be going with friends who have never been to Europe before, so we were thinking of squeezing in another destination if we do the 4-days.",Tomorrowland,1632247458

First-Timer looking to go to TML Winter,"Hi everyone! I’m a newbie to the whole process of buying tickets for Tomorrowland and I was looking for some infos. So as post title says, me and some friends of mine want to go to the winter edition; now, since I noticed the packages (which went on sale on the 18th) are rather costly, I was wondering if I could grab passes for everyone later around november when they say they’re going to go for sale or later in the year anyway. However, the site says that the passes that go for sale are a “limited quantity”. I wanted to know, how limited usually? Are sales so fast I risk not going? Also, how much are the 4-day packages normally? Because if it’s  less than the 7-day ones and they’re “safer” than the passes they could be a better option maybe.",Tomorrowland,1632140813

Tomorrowland 2017 - W2 - Freedom Stage - Sunday - Cirez D - Closing flare,"Hey guys! 

  
I went to Tomorrowland 2017 (Amicorum Spectaculum) during the second weekend and I remember closing the Sunday at the Freedom Stage which was hosted by Eric Prydz (I'm not sure at this point). I remember he played as Cirez D and at the last moments of the show someone in the crowd lighted a red flare (Something crazy considering the stage was indoor). Security arrived promptly and told him to put it away (I don't remember if they took him out from the venue). 

I was remembering all of this and tried to look for videos of that moment but I cannot seem to find anything on YouTube or any other social.

Tomorrowland wants 3 weekends in July 2022,"Tomorrowland wants three weekends next year: “Economic necessity”

Tomorrowland wants not two, but three festival weekends in Boom next summer. For this, the organization will submit an application to the concerned municipalities and the province. “In addition to the desire to pull out all the stops, there is also an economic necessity,” it sounds.

The events sector was completely at a standstill for eighteen months. And when Tomorrowland takes place again next summer, it will be three years ago. Moreover, delay on top of postponement led to a financial hangover of 25 million euros, in addition to financial worries for suppliers, freelancers and all kinds of employees.

That is why the organization will submit an application to the municipalities of Boom and Rumst and the province of Antwerp to exceptionally increase the capacity of the festival. Read: making three successive festival weekends possible once in July 2022, again in the De Schorre recreation area. Read: to compensate for all cancellations.

“In addition to the incredible desire to pull out all the stops in 2022, after two years there is also an economic need to start up, look positively to the future and make up for the enormous losses step by step,” it sounds. in a communication. The proposal has already been checked with the parties involved and will be further investigated in the coming weeks, in consultation with local residents.

In concrete terms, it concerns these weekends, for which 400,000 tickets have already been sold: July 15, 16 and 17, July 22, 23 and 24 and July 29, 30 and 31.

The Province of Antwerp already evaluates the application positively. “The organization and recreation area De Schorre can boast of good cooperation over many years. We want to value it and perpetuate it,” says deputy Jan De Haes. “And we want to take our responsibility towards the many economic players associated with Tomorrowland, including the hospitality industry. The festival has a major impact on tourism in the province and throughout Flanders.”

Rest, safety and health

For a long time it looked like Tomorrowland would continue last summer, but in the end the organization pulled the plug. Mayors Jeroen Baert (N-VA) van Boom and Jurgen Callaerts (N-VA) van Rumst decided to refuse the permit application for the postponed edition. That should have taken place at the end of August and the beginning of September.

They referred to the lack of a ministerial decision and a clear legislative framework and the pressure on the shoulders of the police, which should check all corona certificates. In the background there was also unrest among the local residents, who feared, among other things, a disturbed night's sleep at the start of the new school year. “We have a personal, legal and moral obligation to ensure public peace, safety and health,” said the mayors.

The Tomorrowland organization decided not to submit a new application. ""Given our long cooperation with the municipalities, we do not want to turn it into a legal battle,"" it sounded.

TML Winter bus trips from Switzerland gone? Traveling from USA,"I received a refund for my TML Winter 2020 trip, canceled the night before I was leaving (bags packed!) and I still have my Air France ticket, so I'm definitely going this year.

TML previously had bus routes from Switzerland, and I was really looking forward to spending time in Geneva and meeting new friends on the bus trip to Alpe d'Huez, but they are no longer listed on the website (only Belgium, France, Netherlands)

Are there non-TML bus trips planned? Surely there are party-goers in Switzerland still :)

Or are there other close options? Lyons doesn't have a bus either, and I'd rather not spend 8+hrs on a bus if I can avoid it.

The plane tickets , where do you land ? because by the looks of things it's in lyon, if so are there TML coaches waiting there to pick you up on arrival (and take you back on departure) and take you to the alps or is this something separate you'd have to arrange ? and if so do you have any recommendations?

Skiing gear: does you ski lift and pass include the ski equipment ? or again is this something you'd have to go about doing yourself? and if so where can you hire it from ? (and price of hire? )

i'm sorry if these seem like stupid questions, i'm trying to get a full picture of how much this trip might actually cost.

Not Interested In TomorrowLand Anymore,"So I just wanted to say I have sympathy for everyone who’s been ripped off by TomorrowLand the past year or two. Was interested in going for the first time but after the way they’ve treated their festival-goers since Covid happened, I thought, “Screw that!” Was thinking of going to the winter one for my first time next year but I’m really sorry a bunch of you who have already bought tickets for the past 1-2 years have really been taken advantage of and treated like garbage. I hope a lot of you are able to fairly get your money back or press a successful class-action lawsuit.

Looking for a refund? You now have to wait an entire year.,"Unless I am misunderstanding, you now have to wait a year before requesting a refund? WTF?

Per TML's TOC:

You are not obliged to redeem the Travel voucher. If you did not use the Travel voucher within a period of 12 months after it has been issued, you have the right to request reimbursement of what you actually paid for the cancelled holiday. In that case, TL Travel will have a period of no more than 6 months after the expiry of the 12-month period to make the cash refund to you.",Tomorrowland,1628785836

Name Change,"Hey all, recently been in contact with a lady that claims I can purchase her ticket for 200USD and that a name change is currently possible.

I have never been to Tomorrowland, but am very eager to go and was wondering if this price is correct, and if it is true that name changes are currently possible. She said it was possible because she hasnt registered her own name yet or something of that sort.

She seems genuine, but the situation seems kinda scammy. Especially as from what I could gather from Tomorrowlands website was that name changes will not be possible until 2022.

All help and tips are appreciated!🙌🏼

My response and experience of ATW," I know I’m a bit late but I wanted to type up a bit of a review. I thought I’d shed some light on the most recent virtual event as I’ve seen a lot of people feeling like they think Tomorrowland has “lost its touch.” I’m writing this review with a bit of experience of online festivals and events as, over the past 2 years, I’ve watched every virtual: Tomorrowland, EDC, Lost Horizon, Block Fest, Awakenings, Lost Lands, Defqon, Mysteryland, Qlimax, Gud Vibrations and Individual Artist (W&amp;W, Illenium, Porter, Fox Stevenson Pizza Party, Deborah De Luca, Charlotte De Witte, and a lot more). A majority of these I have watched live from Australia no matter what timezone I have to adjust to. All have a unique way of addressing the online format but Tomorrowland is definitely my number 2 (after Defqon).

When you have a look at the line-up it can definitely seem underwhelming, I totally agree. But the further you dig into the artists and acts the more impressive it actually is. I’ve spent the past week watching each and every set and there are some real dingers in there.  
Friday was a bit disappointing but some acts really surprised me. HI-LO (Oliver Heldens alias) was a really boppin set with some great tech-house. There were a couple of ID’s he played which absolutely banged. Pretty sure there were some that he made with Reinier Zonneveld which is a mind-blowing collab. Rebuke was awesome, Fedde Le Grand was quite same-y, Kolsch live was a must-see, and Adam Beyer was a bloody bop. Charlotte De Witte was incredible, as always, playing some amazing techno. Vini Vici was probably my favourite set of the day though. It just went off, no other way of describing it. So many bloody rolling bangers. Alan Walker, I’ve never personally been a fan of, but it was okay I guess.  
Saturday however, was absolutely stacked. So many amazing sets. Topic was a delightful surprise (especially because I had never heard of him). Claptone was such a vibe with his incredible choons and bops. Sam Feldt, Robin Schultz and Nicky Romero played some really nice tracks which reminded me of sitting upon the top of the hill dancing with all the amazing strangers of TML. Armin played an okay set with some great sing-along tracks which got me and my mates screaming at the top of our lungs. Oh as if I could forget the “surprise” act Afro-slut (jokesjokes). He was alright I guess, played some nice mixes of classic proggy songs. The whole core stage was fucking incredible and a must-watch if you're into tech-house or techno. Mind Against and Amelie Lens were fan favourites amongst my mates as they played some breathtaking techno. The cave, other than having my favourite stage design, was my favourite place for sets. Fox Stevenson was my number one set the whole weekend. So many vibey and banging DnB tunes to jam out to. Koven played some awesome backup DnB and Darren Styles was a great surprise. The Wall was pretty good with some alright acts. The standouts were Da Tweekaz b2b Ran-D and Angerfist. The b2b was nice with some super jumpy dingers and ofc some good sing-along hardstyle. Angerfist was just hard. Really, really hard. To be honest, I didn’t expect anything less from him. The Saturday Elixr stage was a tad disappointing and the only sets I really enjoyed were Mike Williams and Vintage Culture who played some of that classic proggy music. It was a nice vibe but some artists were a bit underwhelming. Moosebar stage, however, is so underrated. If you’ve ever been to the Moosebar stage at TML, it was legitimately the exact same vibe with classics mixed with old school bangers and German/Dutch songs (Heli-heli-heli-helikopter).  
I’ve heard a lot of hate about this online event but I honestly think it was their best one yet. The design of the stages is absolutely incredible and you can tell that there was so much thought that went into it. The details of the Amicorum Spectaculum was mental. From the clips of real people during the mainstage sets, to the light shows and fireworks, it all worked so well. The effects were definitely improved from their past editions which is great to see that they took on that feedback. The new design of the Mainstage, Elixr and The Cave were so well done that I was constantly impressed during the entire viewing. The crowd sounds were a bit loud at some points but I mean have you heard a DV&amp;LM Tomorrowland set? It’s definitely louder than this.

In Conclusion, I honestly think that it’s not that Tomorrowland made a bad event, but more so that people are getting bored with online events. I really do feel bad for ID&amp;T and the Tomorrowland staff for being in such a crappy situation. From being in the unknown from the Belgian government for so long, to having to think of ideas and create unforgettable events during the pandemic. They’ve honestly done a fucking incredible job and I really do think we have to hand it to them for the effort they’ve put in. This online event was magical, as always. If this were to be the first online event Tomorrowland did, I’m sure there would be so many more people frothing over it. But, unfortunately, this has had to be the third event and people are just tired of watching a computer screen drinking alone or with a small group of friends.  
The acts were great with some real superstar sets. The stage design was mind-blowing. The genres were such a great mix. I found myself headbanging, jumping, techno side-stepping, grooving and shuffling all throughout the viewing. Nothing less than magical.

Tomorrowland isn’t losing its touch… People are getting bored and frustrated.

It hurts to watch. It's not a McDonald's commercial. If I was at Tomorrowland I'd stand in the same place for 6 hours and love it. It seems to be a case of ""We do because we can"".

Please get a decent director, build _immersion_ instead of distraction, and tell a story with each set. Show the DJs for a minute or so. Hell, look at the old sets with live crowds on your own YT channel and do that! 

From Australia I've done all the virtual festivals, and while the graphics are better, the production is worse in each instance. And the faster the BPM the worse it gets!

Tomorrowland inspired us to learn to DJ,"Pretty much a weekly podcast of TML inspired music made from at least two different countries: [https://soundcloud.com/d-fiandkronos/episode-043-red-lion-opener](https://soundcloud.com/d-fiandkronos/episode-043-red-lion-opener)

Backstory:

TML 2018 - my first time at Tomorrowland. Loved it. Got right into dance music, having been a rock fanboy with a secret crush on EDM for 15 years. Got home, bought software and hardware. Taught myself to DJ and also my mate too. We start playing house parties, bars, pool parties, all sorts.

I get a new job in China. Mate is staying in Egypt. TML 2019 is our last hurrah. 

TML 2019 - took said mate to TML, he loves it too. Had the idea of doing mixes and sending them to one another. 

Jan 2020 - COVID lockdowns begin. Mixes are being sent regularly. Start the conversation about what to do with them. Decided to start a podcast so we could make sure we stayed in touch. It's been nearly a year with weekly episodes being posted, you can hear the influence of Tomorrowland (to the point that we did a bingo card for one of the episodes), and while we're all waiting patiently for the start of TML 21 online, and TML 2022 to see all our mates again, you can listen to this in the meantime. 

Present day - we've done 44 episodes of music and us talking bollocks over the top of it. We've had guests on, we've done live mixes, but basically it's a chronicle of two DJ fanboys who miss each other so much that we started our own show. Give it a listen while you're waiting for that live stream at TML. :)",Tomorrowland,1626401616

Global Journey Travel Schedule,Can TML please offer us the option to change our travel schedule. Many of us do not even reside in the country we originally chose to start our travel package from. I'm quite sure with the number of cancellations and refunds those who roll over and want to change itenary can be easily accomodated.,Tomorrowland,1624728844
Travel Insurance on TML Rollover ???,"We have GJ from New York (value 5000USD). We rolled over last year and obviously being asked to do again. Or (maybe) get a refund around 6-9 months later which also happens around the time when they will start selling remaining 2022 tickets. See what they did there ;) 

I started looking into travel insurance for 2022 on my Tomorrowland Global Journey travel package. My first quote was $330USD but you really have to read the fine print. I don't think it would cover another Covid/pandemic situation but might cover if TML goes bankrupt or other interesting scenarios which all seem possible these days. This way (as US citizen) I could get my money back through a US company rather than dealing with a international legal issue that would cost around $1000-$2000 just to resolve maybe in 2 years. The fine print here is key.

It is essentially booking a new trip when you hit that rollover button on your tickets. Couldn't you now insure that privately and maybe cover any scenario? I think TML should connect with a reputable international insurance (also covering covid like situations) and offer a deeply discounted rate for people to consider rolling over their tickets to 2022. They won't so I will keep looking into this. I would feel okay about paying $200-250 maybe for full coverage on a 2022 5000USD package.

Anybody else looked into this? Curious to know opinions on this idea.",Tomorrowland,1624722119

Options for Tomorrowland 2022,"Due to the [cancellation of Tomorrowland 2021](https://www.tomorrowland.com/en/festival/practical/official-statement), Tomorrowland 2022 will be held as the 16th edition of Tomorrowland. Below is an outline of the dates and what your options are for each ticket.

I don't have access to every ticket type, so please correct me if something is wrong. I'll update this as more information comes.

&amp;#x200B;

* Dates
* Regular Tickets
* Global Journey
* If you don't have tickets
* Other Questions

# Dates

**Weekend 1**: Friday 22 July 2022 - Sunday 24 July 2022

**Weekend 2**:Friday 29 July 2022 - Sunday 31 July 2022

As always, Dreamville for camping opens on the Thursday before the festival, and you must leave by Monday the day after the festival before 12:00 CEST. 

# Regular Tickets

[https://www.tomorrowland.com/en/festival/tickets](https://www.tomorrowland.com/en/festival/tickets)

If you have a regular ticket for Tomorrowland 2020 (2021) the tickets are automatically moved over to 2022 for the weekend you have.  If you have weekend 1 tickets they remain as weekend 1, and the same for weekend 2. 

&amp;#x200B;

**If you can't attend** the new dates in 2022, you can offer your tickets to the exchange desk (later in 2021). You will be refunded the amount if your tickets are sold. The exchange desk is the **only** place to buy and sell tickets.  

In previous years, I have never heard of someones tickets not being sold, so you can very confidently assume you will be refunded. 

**If you want to change names** from those already personalised it will be possible in early 2022 to change the names.

&amp;#x200B;

In the past it has been possible to part-sell orders (e.g if you have 4 tickets, you can sell 2 on exchange desk and keep 2).

&amp;#x200B;

# Global Journey

[https://www.tomorrowland.com/en/global-journey/practical/global-journey-packages-2021](https://www.tomorrowland.com/en/global-journey/practical/global-journey-packages-2021)

This includes packages such as hotel, Discover Europe, Discover Belgium.

**If you want to attend in 2022 you MUST confirm by end of day 31st July 2021**. Your tickets will be moved to the new dates. You will pay nothing extra. Travel times may be different to when you bought in 2020.

You can perform free name changes.

**If you do not confirm** you will be issued a voucher for the exact amount you originally paid. This voucher can be used to buy other Global Journey tickets. If you do not use the voucher you can receive the cash value of the voucher after 6 months of the voucher being issued. 

**If you do not want to attend** do not confirm and you'll receive a voucher, and 6 months later cash.

&amp;#x200B;

# If you don't have tickets

The only way for regular (non GJ) tickets is to sign up to the wait list (when it opens) and hope you are offered tickets. Tomorrowland 2022 is currently sold out.

For Global Journey tickets, the wording infers there will be another Global Journey shop instance to buy the tickets which are not wanted.  They are likely to be limited, so follow for updates when more is known.

&amp;#x200B;

# Other

* **Can I use the GJ voucher for Tomorrowland Winter 2022?** It is not known if this is possible yet, but it would be logical. I'll try to find out.
* **When will exchange desk open?** To sell tickets it states late 2021. To buy tickets, it is not known.
* **Will I need to pay more?** If you have a ticket and move to 2022 you will pay nothing more. If you buy a new ticket the price might increase.",Tomorrowland,1624636718
Advice for getting a refund form TML,"By now I am sure everyone has got the email from TML as to what options they are giving us.

It is with heavy heart our organization must announce that the 16th edition of Tomorrowland Belgium cannot take place in 2021. The entire team fought till the end and did everything in their powers to write a new chapter in the history of Tomorrowland.

Our dream was to welcome the People of Tomorrow, who we’ve been missing for too long, to celebrate life to the fullest. But unfortunately, the local government has not given the permit to organize Tomorrowland.

We keep looking positively towards the future and strongly believe that music will unite us again soon.

You will be contacted personally as soon as possible with all the options for your Tomorrowland 2021 ticket.

Tomorrowland still defiant after second denial of permit,"The news item is unfortunately in Dutch but I will summarize the important bits:

Tomorrowland is looking for several options to get the necessary permit, going to the Council of State to counter the decision of the mayors or go for a new permit.

They also state they had a plan to limit the amount of possible corona infections, with among them:
- Only let in fully vaccinated guests (thus abandoning the testing on-site or prior PCR testing)
- People in Dreamville cannot leave the site until the end of the festival
- Travelers coming from ""red zones"" would not be allowed (as determined by ECDC and reflected on info-coronavirus.be )

It is not certain that these extra restrictions will be enough to appease the mayors. The item also states that the second weekend is also problematic but Tomorrowland needs it to, at least, break even.

Statement from Tomorrowland Re. Mayors decision,"https://www.tomorrowland.com/en/festival/practical/festival-update

STATEMENT – JUNE 18, 2021

Dear People of Tomorrow,

Earlier this month, Belgium's national government announced that large-scale festivals can take place from the second half of August. Yesterday, the local government (Boom &amp; Rumst) has decided that the 16th edition of Tomorrowland cannot take place in 2021.

We are very surprised and puzzled by these contradictory messages from our governments. In the next few days we will explore all possible options and try to obtain some clarity for our visitors and suppliers.

The grounds cited for the decision are that the Ministerial Decree regarding maximum capacity (75,000 persons) has not been published. For the time being, according to the mayors, only events up to 400 people can legally be allowed.

However, we have understood from the federal government that both arguments would be resolved very quickly with the publication of the Ministerial Decree and the possibility for the ID check to be carried out by private security, as the latter is a general point of attention for the control of the Digital Green Certificate in Belgium.

Finally, reference is made to a local explanation from the GEMS public health advisory group regarding the advice it has made to the Federal government for the summer plan. The federal government has clearly said that festivals can take place after August 13, provided that extra measures are strictly respected, which we intend to follow at all times.

As Tomorrowland, we first and foremost want to organise a safe festival and we have stated several times that we will always continue to evaluate and anticipate the epidemiological situation.

No Tomorrowland for the second year in a row would in any case be huge disaster for our company, but also for the more than 1500 suppliers involved, many freelancers and our thousands of employees. We are still 100% prepared to organise everything as professionally as possible if the epidemiological situation allows, and to celebrate a great end of the summer together with our visitors.

After 15 years of intensive cooperation, this feels very grim and we find it very unfortunate after the many constructive preparations and conversations and federal commitments that it has come to this point, where we struggle to comprehend what just happened to us and still have to let it sink in a bit. Creating and organising Tomorrowland is our life, and an undertaking on which hundreds of people work every day with great passion for a whole year, day in day out.

We keep looking positively towards the future and strongly believe that music will unite us again. 

Live Today, Love Tomorrow, Unite Forever.",Tomorrowland,1624014360
Can Tomorrowland move?,"So far relations have always been good between Boom / Rumst and Tomorrowland. But this affair does not risk straining relations? It's a blow to the organizers because they had the green light everywhere and it could cause damage.

 Tomorrowland may no longer want to work with cities that will make it lose millions of euros for an absurd and unfounded decision ...  I hope the festival won't move",Tomorrowland,1624010711

2 things they said:  It can't happen because of the new guidelines that are not yet been published allowing 75.000 visitors to come to the festival. We cannot allow something that is set for the future.

The police department declared they cannot identify everyone with their ID and negative test. It is not possible and the waiting lines will be too big.

My opinion about this is that the first reason is bullshit.
2nd reason about the police department is also strange, cause normally they have to check everyone's ID cause Tomorrowland only allows 18+ to visit.

I’m absolutely dead set on going (I’ve waited a long time for the opportunity and I won’t be passing it up) but I have no friends that could afford to take on the cost.
So I’m in a bit of bother, I can bring someone else (by use of the name change) but I’d literally be paying for them to go which seems terribly wrong. I guess the sensible decision would be to postpone to next year where I’d hopefully be able to find someone to come that could afford to pay, but after the last couple of years the thought of another delay hurts me even more than the gaping hole in my bank account.
Oh yeah I also have Mysteryland tickets, with the same person, but let’s not worry about that mess here...

Give choice to roll to 2022 or attend at 2021,"Dear Tomorrowland,

&amp;#x200B;

This year and last many of us have been effected by the situation in many different way. We all got different view and concern, and we all understand you are a business with employee to look after and their family. We respect that.

&amp;#x200B;

But this year many of us feel still the festival is not for us, we all got different reasons. But we are so happy you have the chance to hopefully have the event and bring joy to those want to attend. So I ask for you consider the option to let us with ticket not only exchange desk but to also roll to 2022 if we want. These ticket can easy be sold for 2021 because there is still many people who want to go with no ticket. 

&amp;#x200B;

Those who feel happy to go will go and this make no impact on them, but for those us with circumstances such as not feel safe with only 1 vaccine dose (me - 100% not 2 before September) we want the choice. Allowing move to 2022 give everyone what they want.

&amp;#x200B;

I wish you best for 2021 and I hope all who want attend can do so but please consider our concern and let us have a choice. For you as a business you will get more money in short term from the new sale which can help you overcome many problem and for us as fans of the event we have the peace of mind to know we are not in a position to make us uncomfortable

"Tomorrowland responds: ""Relieved with capacity of 75.000 visitors""","This year, Tomorrowland will take place spread over two weekends at the end of August and the beginning of September. “75,000 visitors per day is about the same as our normal capacity. So we don't have to reduce our festival size and can start making preparations"", Debby Wilmsen of Tomorrowland responds with relief. **The organizers of the dance festival are still waiting for the rules and conditions.**

Tomorrowland normally attracts visitors from all over the world. But be aware that persons from certain countries may not be able to come this time. “We notice that the vaccination roll-out in Belgium is going very smoothly and that also seems to apply to the neighboring countries. So we expect most Europeans to have had two shots by August 13th. But we realize that will not be the case for other countries."" Wilmsen is thinking, for example, of the Brazilian visitors who are normally well represented at Tomorrowland and who will possibly get their money back. Or whose tickets might be carried over to next year.

Pukkelpop, which takes place at the end of August, has not yet responded. They first want to go through a number of details and wait for the rules and conditions.

Time to make legal steps...,"First of all, I regret that I'm not able to go to the festival this year (if it will happen) and most probably nor next year.

Last year, I bought my pass from an **official** travel partner (Hungarian company can be found on the tomorrowland's website), so the refund process not the same as usual. I sent them several emails, Facebook messages, and some SMS as well, that these and those are my problems (work, family etc) so I would like to refund. They didn't answer to any of my messages, 0 communications - but they accept the posts in the facebook group -  so I have to go to the bank and make ""legal"" steps.

Yes this is random,"Truth

The day will come when God will judge humans for sin. You and I have sinned and we all have fallen short of His grace. We have done lots of evil in His sight and He will judge each and every one of us for what we have done.You may not believe in what I’m saying but if I’m right and your wrong you could  go to hell. I think that’s worth telling you. Thankfully God has made a way for me and you sinner to go to heaven that’s Jesus and escape our punishment.NO you don’t have to become a religious fanatic or go to a priest all you have to do is go to Him as you are and believe and have faith for what He did for you. He will make you a new creation. And only Jesus can get you to heaven no good works only HIM. You might not believe in what I’m saying but I think that’s worth telling you.

At the beginning of this year, I was thinking about attending Tomorrowland 2021 but I wasn't able to do so because i couldn't go there on the date.

By the way, I found that Tomorrowland is deferred to august &amp; september, and I want to get a ticket now. As far as I know, the tickets are already sold out, but I guess some people will defer or cancel their tickets due to covid or the changed schedule.

Does anybody know that Tomorrowland will give one more chance of ticketing officially or some other plans? I'm struggling on searching the info..

My initial plan was to take the train back and forth between Boom and Antwerpen. But I now see there are now public transport between 1am and 6am. So we can't stay until the festival places closes, which kinda sucks.

I plan on going in 2022 (hopefully) and I had heard that the best way to get a guaranteed ticket is to purchase the Global Journey Package. But I plan on taking 9 others with me, (not with the global Journey) so I was wondering if it is possible to get the Global Journey package as well as 10P camping package in one go or would I need to attempt to buy both separately.

Also I would be flying out of Texas so if there’s any Texans who have gone or anyone who has gotten the 10P package in the past, I would love to hear y’all’s experiences.

"NFTs and festivals - Would you be interested, or is it a fad?","I'm sure a lot of you have heard recently about a growing hype around NFTs. A lot of artists have started to sell NFTs, and I was thinking that perhaps it's not far from festivals like Tomorrowland starting to look into the space. Over the years, we've seen festival merchandise and apparel grow, with TML by Tomorrowland getting pretty big. I've seen plenty of people wearing it around the city, and at the festival.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;At a really high level, an NFT is a unique collectable that you can buy (e.g a song, or a picture) that is unique to you. You are the owner of the original and have the certificate to prove it. It's comparable to buying an original painting, or a copy print of a painting. The original might be worth $100 because it's original, where as the copies are worth $10 because they're not original.

&amp;#x200B;

In EDM, 3lau, an artist [sold an NFT album for $11.7M](https://djmag.com/news/3lau-sells-first-ever-nft-based-album-117m). Other artists like [Deadmau5 and Rezz](https://edm.com/gear-tech/deadmau5-rezz-hypnocurrency-nft-collection) have also got into this space, as have many others. There's a pretty big market out there for people to own unique collectables.

It made me think, could festivals start to look into this space and is this something that people would actually be interested in buying? For example, you could own a unique digital collectable of the festival, or if we're dreaming big the official Tomorrowland anthem song (if they bring it back).

&amp;#x200B;

Just food for thought on a slightly different topic, but a topic that seems to be growing in EDM at a pretty fast rate. Some say it's just hype, others think it's the future.  

&amp;#x200B;

Can you see festivals getting into this, and is it something you'd be interested in?",Tomorrowland,1619616406

Announcements of the Belgian concertation committee of Friday 23 April,"Sources in French (rtbf) ; traduction : Google trad

 ""In June, indoor and outdoor events with 200 people should be allowed (75% indoor level). Wearing a mask will be compulsory and participants will have to remain seated and respect the distancing.  conditioned on two criteria: the progress of the vaccination campaign (with 80% of people suffering from comorbidities vaccinated) and the intensive care occupancy rate (maximum 500 covid patients).

 A new Consultative Committee will be held on May 11 to clarify what will happen after the months of May and June.

 The cultural sector had tabled on the table of the government and the Gems, the group of experts, an alternative plan.  This proposed a gradual deconfinement of places of cultivation, depending on the evolution of the pandemic, the evolution of vaccination and the number of hospitalizations.

 In its alternative plan, the cultural sector had proposed to allow, from May 8, events bringing together 200 people outside and 100 people inside.

 The consultation committee therefore did not follow what the cultural sector was asking for.  He established, this Friday, the beginning of a deconfinement plan for ""major events"" with a first relaxation within the framework of the ""open air"" plan.  The culture sector is once again perplexed.  An angry situation.  Moreover, for the Minister of Culture in the Wallonia-Brussels Federation, Bénédicte Linard, ""today's consultation committee is a missed opportunity"".

Artists clashing with Creamfields and W1 Tomorrowland?,"Hi Guys, UK fellow here, I was planning to make my debut to tomorrowland this year but, given the uncertainty around the festival. And also the speed of vaccinations going on in the UK where it's projected the entire population will be vaccinated by early August, I booked creamfields. 

&amp;#x200B;

However with the news announced today I have three questions

&amp;#x200B;

1. There are quite a few artists in Creamfields that are scheduled for week 1 in tomorrowland originally. Prydz, Alesso, Guetta, Charlotte de wilde the usual suspects you know how are they gonna appear in both festivals on the same weekend?
2. Did the organisers of Tomorrowland not realise Mysterland **and** Creamfields were happening on the same weekend so (I can speak for my UK guys here) there'd be a crazy clash where people are unfortunately not able to attend Tomorrowland as they already booked tickets to the other festivals?
3. at what date am I able to change my ticket of 4 to 2022? When is the cut off point, everything is quite uncertain right now

If someone could provide actual clarity to what's going on that'd be great, cheers",Tomorrowland,1615990680

Discussion about possible ways to get a refund for the belgian Edition of TomorrowLand,"In my opinion, TomorrowLand provides an amazing festival but horrible customer service. Long before 2020 I had pointed out that the customer service side of things has always been very bad. If everything goes smoothly for you then great, but if you run into an issue they will offer the bare minimum of help or not help at all. 

Examples are as follows:


1. People not getting their treasure case due to an error on TomorrowLand's fault like not putting all of the address details on the box. They wont send you another one nor do they refund it.

2. People not getting the English books for TL 2019 and being promised one in the future, most never got theirs.

3. The TomorrowLand Winter Refund debacle. 

4. TomorrowLand summer 2020 virtual festival goodie bags, shipped late during a pandemic and offered no resolution. I bought the most expensive package and it was shipped 2 days before the virtual festival. They addressed this for the New Years edition by at least admitting you may not get the package in time.

5. TomorrowLand summer 2020 virtual festival website crashing not allowing you to reenter a stage for an hour. TomorrowLand's official response to me was to pay 5 euro for the re-watch package. 5 euro, they could have given that as an act of good faith in my opinion.

There are many other issues but I just do not care to look them up right now. The main reason I am mentioning this is that it is my OPINION that TomorrowLand cannot be trusted with our money. There is not much hope that TomorrowLand can throw a full edition of their festival this year just based off the fact that many boarders do not plan to reopen this year which prevents patrons and many artist from showing up.

There COULD be ways to get a refund, I am not a lawyer, this is not legal advice and there is a chance TomorrowLand could void your tickets and not refund you based off of what I have seen from other people. The choice is yours but hopefully the information I have put together will help you decide the path you want to go. Me personally. I got a refund for my package as it was expensive and I did not feel like giving an interest free loan to TomorrowLand. 




1. TomorrowLand DOES actually have an official way (post covid) to get a refund for non-global journey tickets that they have not advertised but it is on their website.

https://faq.tomorrowland.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045966252

&gt; ""if you can prove you are unable to attend the event in 2021 for a serious and valid reason, you can apply for a refund. We will refund you the price of your ticket within one month of receiving your refund request and proof of why you cannot attend (e.g., attendance at a wedding, sickness, professional obligations, etc.).""

It should be easy for most to provide one of the requested documents to apply for the refund.

If that does not work because you have a travel package then I have a POSSIBLE solution for you.

It was 7 months ago when I first saw a post from /u/XORosaurus where he successfully defended the chargeback when TomorrowLand fought the bank to keep the money. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Tomorrowland/comments/hw7dbc/successfully_defended_chargeback_dispute_us/

With that and with an update that /u/MiNiMaLHaDeZz posted a few days ago I created the following template that might work for you.

&gt; At this point I would like to formally request a refund.
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to get a full refund (not a voucher) for my Order ID XXXXXXXX. Under EU law this ticket includes accommodations greater than one day and is therefore a travel package.
&gt; 
&gt; I am well aware of the Belgian law, specifically the 19 March 2020 Ministerial Decree and the amended law Belgian laws, Ministerial decree of 7 April 2020, The Ministerial Decree of September 14, 2020, and The Ministerial Decree of December 15, 2020 that allow for vouchers to be issued. However also under Belgian law customer rights with regards to package travel are specifically protected under European Union law, which supersedes national law for member states, such as Belgium, as confirmed on 22 May 1971 by the Belgium Court of Cassation.
&gt; 
&gt; The European Commission further confirmed these protections apply with regards to the COVID-19 crisis in Commission Recommendation (EU) 2020/648 as well as in written guidance published on 5 March 2020 and updated on 19 March 2020.
&gt; 
&gt; The alteration of the travel dates to 2021 or 2022 constitutes a significant alteration to a main characteristic of the travel package as per Article 5(1)(a)(i) of Directive (EU) 2015/2302. Per Article 11(2)(b) of Directive (EU) 2015/2302, this entitles the travelers the right to termination of the contract without paying a termination fee.
&gt; 

Below mentions they could keep a small fee which is 5 euro per ticket but if you read the EU Directive, it gives you the right to a refund without any fee. Me personally I would consider it a win if you got a refund without the fee.

https://www.tomorrowland.com/en/festival/practical/general-terms-conditions

&gt;  1.18    Ticket Refund Fee: in case a Festival admittance ticket purchased via Tomorrowland (through the Paylogic platform) is refunded after purchase, subject to the refund provisions provided for herein, a ticket refund fee will be charged per refunded ticket and therefore deducted from the amount of the refund. The Ticket Refund Fee depends on the ticket cancellation date, in accordance with article 1.22, and will be announced prior to the official start of the Tomorrowland tickets ales on www.tomorrowland.com


Final thoughts:

I thought about not sharing this, I have had most of this researched since November but after seeing the TomorrowLand winter lack of refund post recently (which is in France and Belgian law probably does not apply but the Directive (EU) 2015/2302 should apply as most packages were travel packages) I decided to make this post. I love going to the festival itself. Its a great production but TomorrowLand uses the fact that no matter how bad the customer service is, the festival will seemingly sell out, they choose to not assist the average customer. 

It should not be difficult for TomorrowLand to at least open up an exchange desk that is always open with rolling ticket availability always an option. I know for a fact that all tickets that were in the exchange desk before December 1st were all sold. So why not keep that option open. Once again, just bad customer service.

Hopefully this information could help some people. You may need to speak with an EU attorney about enforcing the EU directive or you may simply be able to e-mail TomorrowLand for a refund and get it. Your Mileage May Vary (common term in the US that means you could get a different result than someone else with the same issue).",Tomorrowland,1615579823

New lineup 2021 (aug-sept),"In case the rumors are true, TML21 will clash with Creamfields &amp; ML on W1, ASOT festival on W2 (and surely with other reshceduled festivals).
If you have a look to the Creamfields lineup per day, you'll see that most of the djs who are apparently performing at TML are playing at Creamfields too, so the lineup will be different for sure.
For example: Eric Prydz will do the Holosphere show at Creamfields on Friday 27, so no Holosphere on Friday W1 at TML. Tiësto and Martin Garrix are part of the Sunday lineup at Creamfields, so their TML performances won't be on Sunday.
What do you think about the new lineup and those possible changes?",Tomorrowland,1615399495

I am switching jobs and will obviously lose access to the mailbox. Since changing the email for your TML account is not possible I would either ask tomorrowland to connect it to another email address if thats possible or transfer the tickets to my main gmail account which holds the one global journey ticket. 

Now I'm wondering if transferring it to the gmail is allowed since it holds one global journey ticket but I still don't exceed the 4 ticket rule.

Tomorrowland Winter - Voucher Voided,"So yesterday I logged onto my tomorrowland account to check out the status of my voucher and saw it was voided.

I know vouchers being voided is common for people who have done a chargeback through their credit card company. I have not done this.

I wanted to ask if any of you are experiencing the same issue? That could mean it is part of the refund execution process where the voucher gets listed as voided at some point.

Alternatively, I am getting screwed out of a lot of money.




UPDATE: I've still received no response to my support email, but I did receive an email saying my refund has been processed and should be in my account in the next 5 business days.",Tomorrowland,1612263598

What's the most outlandish thing that happened to you during a Tomorrowland?,"Here's my little story:

I was pumped to end the second day of Tomorrowland 2019 with a bang, so I decided to loosen my body to Nina Kraviz's closing set. The crowd was super crazy (at least in the section that I stayed around), and I was feeling real good when the set ended (by the way, shame that they didn't record that set, as confirmed by Nina herself).

I was staying in Antwerp and was ready to go back to my hotel and have some nice sleep before revving up for the last day. My intention was to take the train and so I went along with the sea of people inching towards the exit. I was perhaps a little drunk and surely super dazed after that banger of a set, and made the ominous wrong turn to the GJ bus station. I walked what seemed like an eternity (probably, like 30-45 minutes), and slowly started to realize that this wasn't the path that I had taken the previous day.

Anyways, I reached the GJ bus station, and for reasons unbeknownst to me ended up in a bus going to one of the car parking. Everyone got off the bus and started getting in their cars, while I stood their perplexed as to where to go now. Luckily, the bus was still making the U-turn, so I ran and waved the driver, who opened the door, saw my face and let me in without saying a word.

I reached back the GJ bus station, and decided that the only way to get back to Antwerp was to retrace my steps. So, I walked back - on a now partially deserted path - to the Tomorrowland entrance. For obvious reasons, I was the only one walking in the opposite direction on that path. I reached the main gate after another toiling walk, and saw the sign that I missed the first time around. It was past 3 AM now, and I knew there wouldn't be any trains running until the morning, and I really wanted to have a cozy sleep and a nice shower in the morning. So, I stopped at the taxi stand and luckily for me found a taxi instantly (there weren't many people remaining at that time, so no surprises there).

I sat in the taxi and told the driver the address of my hotel. He presented me two fare options: a meter based price, or a fixed price. He made the fixed price sound like a great deal (which I later realized was a rip off), which I gladly accepted. I reached back my hotel past 4 AM. Payed the driver and immediately crashed into my bed.

I wasn't very pleased with this experience (mostly, angry at my stupidity), but now that I look back on it, I find it very amusing, because when will I get to do something like that again!",Tomorrowland,1612176672

Tomorrowland 2021,I just don’t understand why they festivals organisers just say before you are allowed entry to Tomorrowland or to go on your flight (if you’re global journey) that you need to show a negative COVID test result which has to be taken in a certain time period. Just baffles me as I know it’s worrying times but it’s not like the virus will just magically disappear it’s will be around for the rest of our life’s in some form of another so surely this is the only logical situation that can be taken place to get festivals back in place ?

Tomorrowland GJ Treasurecase Willcall Pickup?,"i’m in a bit of a pickle atm and am hoping you fine people of TML can help provide some insight. 

currently i have my treasure cases shipping address to my current location, i know realistically 2021 TML won’t happen this year. the problem is by this time next year there’s a 99% chance i would’ve moved addresses (currently looking to buy a place). 

the problem is i obviously don’t know where i’ll live next, having the treasure cases shipped to my current address is also not feasible. i emailed TML help desk and they said after the 2/28 deadline they’re unable to change shipping addresses as “the database will be closed”. i’m not able to change it even if i pay - as i asked what the fee will be for address changes. 

so i’m wondering if anyone has done GJ treasure case will call? i have a hotel package and the site says i can pick up my treasure case at my hotel but the help desk said i can only pick it up on festival grounds which is also unideal cause i don’t want to carry it around all day. so idk what to do about the shipping. 

my only potential option is put my parents address but they live in a house and i’m paranoid someone will steal the treasure cases - will tracking be provided with the TC?

if you made it this far thanks for reading, and appreciate the help!",Tomorrowland,1611582069

Not actually receiving the ticket, so I never had a copy, knowing what was happening in the world, I quickly sold my ticket for a less inflated price of what I bought for.

How should this be legal, if I never had a ticket to be able to scam someone with in the first place?

It's hard to see how many people watch the festival per ticket, in July the mean was 8 people. 6 million of the 10 was paid by TML themselves; tickets brought in 1,5 million dollars and a sponsor did the rest. That is how they broke even. 

This time there were 140k tickets sold.",Tomorrowland,1609515338
Awesome night,"I heard there were some problems for people getting the stream to work, for me personally on my laptop the video didn't work but the sound did. on iPad everything worked immediately. After about fifteen minutes the whole show was available on laptop again. I had just bought a surround sound set (aka 4 jbl speakers put around me) in the living room, hooked laptop up to the tv and wow what an experience. Had a quick delay around Tchami's set but that was really about it. 

How amazing is it that they could time the midnight moment so perfect, it was only like 3 seconds off. And I had such a great time the entire night, it was amazing. Best sets are both from 1 dude, Guetta. His Jack Back set was imo the best of the night (that I checked). I was just laying on the couch with sound from everywhere, a cold beer in my hand and that epic show on screen. So I want to not only say hats off to TML for creating this livestream that was just better in almost every way (stability issues) but also a quick wow for Guetta for this massive comeback he's been making since about 2019. I think he deserves to be number 1 in DJMag this year. 

My only 'complaint' about the summer edition is that the crowd looked a bit off wel wow they changed that! Flags in the audience, TML and countries. People on people's backs, some areas were full with people and others were more quiet, in the back people were taking a break. Wow.",Tomorrowland,1609510434

Respect to Tomorrowland!,I must admit that in the last years I fell a bit out of love with Tomorrowland as it always feels more and more like just another commercial product (with the two weekend thingy and the constant spam about Dimitri Las Vegas and Like Mike). But I have to say that this virtual festival was really nice and q well thought concept. I was at a small party and we had a big screen showing it. It gave a special vibe and it was nice to see the Djs playing in front of some crowd 👍🏻,Tomorrowland,1609505193

Setup suggestions for zoom/conference with friends?,"Hi all,

Looking forward to the NYE event. 

Wondering if anyone has any suggestions for the best way to set up a zoom/Skype/FaceTime conference call with friends who can’t join in person in one house. 

We will all buy separate passes to the festival, however the issue with zoom/Skype/FaceTime etc is how best to see/speak to each other while limiting the amount of feedback/echo from the background music on each side (can be hard to fully enjoy the music and chat together if hearing delayed music feeding back from their side of the call).  

Does anyone have any ideas with this? 

Also, do we know whether there is anyway that people in other time zones can change their schedule to join our local time zone?

Updating the Lineup/Timetable Database,"Hello everyone,

I have been running [edmfestivalguide.com](https://edmfestivalguide.com/) for almost two years now. What initially had a calculator to determine how much a ticket to Tomorrowland would cost (a really shitty calculator with really shitty coding) turned into a bigger website (with more stuff and less shitty coding). I now have added a bunch of things like Tomorrowland food+drink price lists, a pearl converter and even dipped my toes into a couple other festivals (tml winter and parookaville).

Anyway, my favourite part of the website is the timetable database. The idea is to essentially have every act ever to occur at Tomorrowland sorted by year, weekend, date, stage, stage host and time slot. Unfortunately, the database is incomplete and gets VERY spotty towards the years 09, 08 and farther back. It would be great if anyone, who would like, could DM me or comment with sources that show past lineups, time slots, stages and what not (links, booklets, really anything). I would also love pictures/pdfs of the timetables they hand out at the festival. I'm having a hard time finding those.

You can head over to [edmfestivalguide.com/tomorrowland/lineup](https://edmfestivalguide.com/tomorrowland/lineup) to see what I have and what's missing. I would be very grateful for your help to complete this database so that we as fans can always look past on who played where at what time etc.

(And yes I know sometimes the database says something about ""reaching quota limit"". The database host is turning into a subscription model so I will have to change that eventually.) 

Lastly, I have also removed all ads that I had running on the site. While they initially covered my website expenses almost to the penny the first year, they really haven't this past year. Nevermind the fact that they absolutely ruined the aesthetics of the website. I figured since the ads pissed me off they probably ruined the user experience as well. So, gone they are. That leaves me with paying the server and domain cost every year which really isn't crazily expensive (roughly 10$/month). However, if you want to support the domain/server costs, feel free to ""buy me a coffee"". I didn't want to advertise that link here. You can find the button on the website though. 

That's it from me. I hope I can fix the empty spots that the database has right now :)

Cheers.",Tomorrowland,1608916861

# The Premier League: Everything You Need To Know

This is an AI generated article about the Premier League

## Section 1: A Brief History on the Premier League

* 1. The Premier League is the Premier League!

Like anything else in life, if you just look at it on its own, it may appear a little dull. But rest assured, this is how the Premier League started. So how did the Premier League begin? It all started when the English Football League was formed in 1888. The first four seasons saw seven teams join and play each other twice with the top four going through to the next season's final. Leicester City then won the league and ended the season with the newly created Football League First Division as their champions.

2. The First Championship Win

The first ever championship win was Leicester's in 2017. That win was in addition to Leicester City being crowned as the 2016-2017 Premier League champions.

## What makes the league so special?

The Premier League is a truly great league with wonderful stories of great players and iconic managers. It's arguably the best league in the world because of the volume of quality available. There are at least 10 world-class teams with star players in every position and some of the best managers. This is arguably the most competitive league in the world and where to get a trophy at the end of the season. If you are a manager then this is a dream league to manage in. The Premier League has been around for three decades but has maintained its prestige and without question, remains the world's most popular league.

Player types

There are a lot of types of players in the Premier League.

Number 10: This is the most common position and is the classic attacking player.

## How does the league work?

Teams are placed in six tiers of five teams each. For the purpose of this simulation, this season was the Premier League season.

The first four tiers are all made up of 25 teams, each with a home stadium that holds 25,000 fans.

Teams play each other twice in their tier in a home-and-away game. The teams in the final tier (the top 8) are the teams that qualify for the playoffs.

The playoff for each tier of the Premier League consists of two legs, with a draw decided after each. The first team to win a tie on the second leg takes the higher-ranked team's place in the next tier. The team that loses a tie has to play the highest-ranked team in the previous tier (assuming no team has been promoted), but only a draw is needed in that case.

Who regrets or relishes their 2021 transfer decision more? Jesse Lingard vs Joe Willock,"Both players really came to life during their respective loan spells last season. Both scoring some high impact goals lifting each side up in the table and lifting their profile up as well. Both warranting the players and the clubs strong considerations to make some transfer decisions in the summer. 

Jesse Lingard opted to stay at parent club Manchester United, using his performance at West Ham to up his value with OGS and fight for a place in the side. Joe Willock choosing to make the permanent move to Tyneside and embrace the Geordie love and lifestyle. 

Both Manchester United and Newcastle United in turmoil, falling well short in performance and table aspirations. To boot for Lingard, West Ham currently 3rd in the table, 3 places above Manchester United. Joe Willock facing relegation battle with NUFC early on. But the club having the prospect of the takeover going through boosting them up in the short and long term.

The Shelf Life of a Premier League Manager," 

A mere 298 days had passed between Claudio Ranieri’s Leicester spectacularly winning the [Premier League](https://www.statista.com/topics/1773/premier-league/) and the aforementioned manager being sacked by the club he had brought such unexpected glory. Elite football management is a cut-throat business.

As this infographic shows though, the Foxes aren’t the most ruthless club in the league when it comes to showing managers the door. Of the current top-flight teams that have played in the Premier League for at least ten seasons, Crystal Palace have spent the average shortest amount of time with each of their managers – 450 days.

The shortest tenure at the South London club was that of Frank de Boer. His ill-fated stint lasted just 77 days after Palace failed to score a single goal in his four league games in charge. In fairness, de Boer was replaced by Roy Hodgson who went on to lead the side for 1,350 days before making the decision himself to call an end to his time as boss– a rare luxury for a Premier League manager – saying: ""The time is right to step away from the rigours of top-flight Premier League football.""

The other end of the scale is somewhat skewed by two legends of the dugout – Arsène Wenger at [Arsenal](https://www.statista.com/study/65916/arsenal-football-club/) and Sir Alex Ferguson at [Manchester United](https://www.statista.com/topics/2376/manchester-united/). Combined, the two spent 17,598 days at their respective clubs. After periods of such stability often come turbulent times though, and for United especially, this has been the case. Calculating for the post-Ferguson era, United’s average would be just 749 days. Arsenal’s first attempt at replacing Wenger – Unai Emery - was ended after 555 days, while Mikel Arteta is still in charge after 687.

After just 11 games this season, 5 clubs have already parted ways with their manager and chances are there’s at least one more club with a drafted press release containing the phrase: “We would like to thank &lt;insert manager’s name&gt; for his dedication and hard work.""

You have to pick an 11 from the current Prem for 1 match against an 11 of players you didn’t pick. Who would you take if you need to win? What changes if you only need a draw?,"One match to save your life. Or get a lifetime supply of your favourite thing if you’re morbid and would pick mostly from teams beginning with N. 

You can pick any players from the current premier league squads and use any formation. You get a starting 11 and 3 subs, continuing with the assumption there will be no injuries. 

For the sake of argument we will assume you get a month and some friendlies with guarantee of no injuries to help build chemistry/cohesion so you don’t feel obliged to pick all from one team. 

Your opposition will be an 11 of players picked from the premier league who you didn’t pick. So it’s really you against the best of the rest. Maybe you don’t think Salah, De Bruyne and Lukaku work well together, and but would you risk having one of them against you? I’m really not sure. 

I’m curious if anybody’s 11 would change if you only need a draw. You could put lukaku with van dijk and someone at CB and almost guarantee nobody will score a header against you, play Salah in a flat midfield 5 so he’s not as effective but he’s not on the opposition.",PremierLeague,1636938243

Switching Club Loyalty (Chose one too fast?),"Look. I hate to be that guy and yes I'm an American. My friends have told me to watch football all throughout high school, like just watch champions league they said. I never did but now I do. I started following every game this Spring and I had trouble picking a club to follow. 
In my naiveness I chose Spurs after a week of doing research and I know the stigma with being a Spurs supporter and where the club is right now but I feel that I made a mistake. When I say naiveness let me stress it is about the time I took to choose a club.
Football has really become my favorite sport and it was perfect timing for all the international tournaments this summer to keep engaged. 
I know switching clubs is absolutely unacceptable. And i feel that too in America if anyone knows about the Texas Longhorns. I've been a fan of them my entire life and my pops is one too so I know how to stick through the hard times and cheer for a team that has historically been good and is now going through a decade long and who knows how much longer stretch of mediocrity.
It's just I think that 5-6 months is ok to switch teams. I guess when I've watched every match week now this season, I really see what I like and don't like.  I just don't know what it is but something inside me tells me Liverpool is for me. I feel like I could really cheer for Liverpool even if they were in the same position as Spurs' are. The songs, Anfield, right now at least Salah, Klopp. Man. I don't know what I expect out of this post, I just feel like I had to put that out there.",PremierLeague,1636905673

Chelsea and City have had plenty of success for the last two decades with their ridiculous spending and their dominance domestically and in Europe, Chelsea's success from 2003 to now, with a bit of success before the Abromovic takeover and City have been Successful since 2012, 4 years after Shiek Mansour take over in 2008. Since 2000, 8 league titles, 2 UCLs, 2 Europa Leagues, 3 UCL finals and a numerous amount of other domestic silverware between them firmly keeps them in the top 5.

Liverpool, United, Arsenal on the other hand haven't had the best of decades. 2000-2010 were their best years, having the invincibles, Ronaldo-Tevez-Rooney, Gerrard, Henry, Bergkamp, Giggs, Scholes, Neville etc. with numerous trophies including 2 UCLs between the 3 clubs in 10 years, that keeps them in it. Yet since 2010, only 2 league titles and 1 UCL title between them has made them not as dominant as they were in the 2000s. Despite that they have still attracted the best of the best and they spent money on them. Pogba, Alexis Sanchez, Ozil, Ronaldo, Sancho, Varane, Thiago Alcantara and more however they have made players either through their youth system (Greenwood, Saka, ESR, TAA etc.) Or have made decent players so much better or in some cases world class (Salah, Mane, Firmino, VVD, Robertson, Allison. This as well as recent success in Liverpool PL and UCL titles keeps them in the top 5.

This leaves the slighty bigger clubs than the rest in England, the likes of Aston Villa, West Ham, Spurs and Leicester City. Spurs have not won a trophy since 2008, the same year City were taken over. Leicester have won a Premier League title and an FA Cup in the last 5-6 years but have no significant history behind them. West Ham and Villa have massively underachieved so they are not good enough to be top 6.

 I have already mentioned they haven't won a trophy since 2008 but were always a top 6 club, they attracted big players, made decent to good players, Son Heung-min being the best out of that. They have attracted the likes of Conte and Jose Mourinho for their dugout but Conte hasn't had enough time to do well and jose was sacked due to the Super League saga. Daniel Levy is also a problem, just like the glazers, he picks what manager to back and which manager not to back. 26 trophies is a great tally  but their last major one, a fa cup, was in 1991.

So what do you think, is it a top 6 or a top 5?",PremierLeague,1636838292

Wouldn't it be great if premier league referees were mic'd up like that? 

After a bit of googling, I read that Michael Oliver was in fact mic'd up when officiating the 2018 FA Cup final.

He is justifying it by saying Pep won 2 CL finals by beating Ferguson's United. He said that Ferguson's 2 champions league titles were won in injury time and in penalties but Pep didn't. He said that Ferguson was more  about man management and motivation and Pep was better tactically. He said that Xavi and Arteta inherited from Pep and Ferguson's players like Neville, Scholes, Giggs, Keane and Ole weren't good managers, hence pep has more influence and legacy than Ferguson.

Which Premier League coach carries the heaviest tax (makes player look better than they are),"Which EPL coach's tax is the heaviest, meaning he is the best in making players look better than they are?

Personally, I think it is the Klopp tax. 

First of all look at how he made Coutinho and Wijnaldum look world class when they have flopped at Barca and PSG respectively. Especially Coutinho's case. When he just came to Barca he was amazing and was an important factor in Barca winning the 17/18 league title. However after he got ''ingrained'' into Barca's coaching system he started to underperform. 

Second of all, players like Henderson, Milner, Firmino etc. I don't think that these players would perform as they do *at this time in their career* with another coach. Not saying they are world class but I think their performances would be even worse if they were under another coach.

Third of all, I think another evidence of the Klopp tax is how he has built both Dortmund and Liverpool to the top. Such rebuilds of course also require great players (Lewandowski, Mo Salah etc) but to me it's evident that if a coach has done it with two clubs that there is something to be said about his ability to make the squad overachieve.",PremierLeague,1636754707

Sess was/is a special player with a back for finding space not unlike Defoe or Thomas mueller. I’m not saying he’s as good as either or would be as good as either but he has something special in his game outside of technical or physical ability. 

Surely Spurs could have spent that money better and Sess would have played maybe 100 or more matches that he’s missed out on. 

Still time at 21, but to have been so good at 17 and spend so much time not playing has got to have a negative effect. A season at hoffenheim on loan is good but when it’s sandwiched by two spells on the bench and occasionally with u-23’s it’s benefits become reduced.",PremierLeague,1636589772

"Tifos, flares, smoke bombs, flags at stadiums.","First off American MLS (Major League Soccer) sucks. 


I follow the USL in the states since my local club belongs in that league. 

My question is why is it that Premier League and any other European League as well as others around the world (except the US) have stadiums where things like tifo's, flags, pyrotechnics, smoke bombs and etc seem to be far more tolerated than stadiums in the US?

I swear it's like most of the fans act like they are watching badminton rather than the beautiful game. Sure they cheer. But other countries fanbases are more passionate about football and stage elaborate tifos and chants and pyro. 

I belong to a fan forum dedicated to my local club and I brought this up to them and posted examples.

Was David Moyes that bad at United?,"I have always rated him he done a great job at Everton he got top 4 and was unlucky not to get into the Champions League.

The United team he took over despite winning the league wasn't that great and was definitely on the decline.

The Fellaini signing was poor in particular but nowhere as bad as Pogba or Maguire.

Why Klopp Should Shift to a 3-5-2,"Hear Me Out:

GK: Alisson

CB: Matip

CB: VVD

CB: Konate

LWB: Robertson

RWB: TAA

CDM: Henderson
 
CDM: Fabinho 

CAM: Mane

ST: Salah

ST: Jota

This would make us more defensively sound and allow for our wingbacks to stay high. It would also make us more compact and our front 3 could shift positions and make us more unpredictable.

David Luiz - No one would say he's world class but on his day, he's up there, and for Cb he can also pick a pass and strike a ball better than most Cbs. 

Hu Ming Son - While he's received many praises again no one would say he's a world class player or put him up there with Mo Salah, but had he been in the right team (as one or two players carrying a team is very difficult) I believe he would have been racking up goals and assists and would definitely be in that bracket.",PremierLeague,1636326701

Pretty much every team have a very cautious but optimistic view, just like us. Even teams like City &amp; United were cautious.

Went onto the Liverpool sub before the game and it’s the first time I’ve seen a set of fans who believed the 3 points were already confirmed. It was very much WHEN they get the 3 points, not if.

One bloke said it would be a tough game and got downvoted.

They didn’t even see us as a threat.

This made me want the win even more, and now it feels so fucking sweet.",PremierLeague,1636311220

Can an unbiased neutral explain the VAR decision for West Ham's first goal?,"I've seen this particular decision 50/50ed across the board, with Liverpool fans adamant it should have been a foul, and Liverpool haters laughing it off. I'd like to hear from neutrals.

Some talking points:
•It is apparent from the VAR replay that Allison's arm is impeded from going forward by the WH player.
•How is this one different from the VVD/De Gea situation back in 19/20?
•How was the decision made from a rules standpoint? If the referee had blown foul and VAR reviewed, would the ref be overturned?",PremierLeague,1636310443

Trent Alexander-Arnold gets unnecessary criticism for his defending for Liverpool.,"I truly believe Trent is a brilliant defender. I think at this point, even rival fans must admit he is the best attacking fullback in the world. But even defensively, although he looks shaky, he isn’t. Klopp plays an extremely aggressive, attacking formation, with the majority of attacking threat emerging from either fullback. As a result of this commitment to attacking from the wide defensive roles, he is also understanding and sacrificing their defensive capabilities as a means of enhancing their attacking qualities. As a result, Trent in particular is often left in situations where he will look out of position, or even simply be beaten on the wing primarily due to the fact he was never set in the “correct” defensive position from the get go. This is simply a byproduct of how Klopp plays, and as a result he will get caught out from time to time, which doesn’t make him a poor defender individually even though it seems so.",PremierLeague,1636293629

EPL Teams Play Style Described by Music Genres,"I was having this discussions with some friends and was curious to hear some more thoughts. This is how I see a few teams:

**Man City (Jazz):** Smooth and artistically woven gameplay that is sublime to watch. While there are moments of individual brilliance, a lot of their strength comes from the way they sync together as a team to control possession and the game.

**Liverpool (Heavy Metal):** Heavy pressing which sometimes leaves the team looking a little open but often produces great opportunities. Each of the starting 11 feels so crucial in their positions and there are lot of great individual plays that lead to their opportunities. Also ruthless in attack.

**Brighton (Classical):** Clean gameplay that is well put together and runs like a smoothly oiled machine. However, they often seem to lack on finishing and star players that can run games on their own.

**Manchester United (Pop):** Flashy by their brand and the caliber of their player roster but lacking in fundamental gameplay. They often produces great moments but feel shaky at their core.

**Newcastle United (Progressive House):** They general seem quite throughout games in attack. But suddenly there's a beat drop and they score a goal from nowhere.

**Leeds (Dubstep):** Can be brilliant at times and be the most entertaining team to watch. But they are often shaky and lacking at their core with low lows.

Do add your own genres for teams and why you see them that way.",PremierLeague,1636289074

West Ham United have achieved a wave of unbeaten point grabbing climax in Premier League, League Cup and Europa League. At present, they have been unbeaten for six consecutive games in various competitions. The team rank 1st in the group of Europa League with 3W-1D, and advanced to the elimination stage two rounds in advance. They have an excellent record even against strong rivals such as Everton, Tottenham and Manchester City recently. Benrahma is in excellent condition for having contributed 5 goals and 3 attacks this season.

&amp;#x200B;

Liverpool have been unbeaten this season so far. Since August, they have maintained an amazing record of 20 consecutive unbeaten games in various competitions. Recently, there has been a wave of climax in Premier League, League Cup and Champions League, which firmly grasp the promotion quota in Champions League. At present, the goal rate of Liverpool is as high as 3 goals Per game, which shows their pierce offense. Moreover, they have a strong ability to fight away from home for a unbeaten record in 13 consecutive away games across the season, and most of them have been won smoothly. But recently Liverpool encountered a wave of collective injuries of midfielders such as Milner and Keïta.

&amp;#x200B;

Liverpool have defeated West Ham United many times in recent years, occupying an absolute psychological advantage. West Ham United can make good use of Liverpool's lack of depth in the middle to score goals. However, Liverpool's amazing state and away performance this season, the number of goals in this game should be considerable. We look forward to Liverpool adding another 3 points in the table.",PremierLeague,1636250291

As of this season do you think Palace would have a claim for Europe.," I mean their worst loss was against Chelsea in there first game this season. 3 0 in your first game under a new manager, a very different looking team, to be your equal worst loss of the season isn\`t very bad. Their only other semi bad loss was against Liverpool who are one of the inform teams in the EPL. Their ladder position right now is 9 (15 points) which could easily be higher as they have had a few tough draws (conceded in the 95th minute and dominated the game) I feel as though they could be 19 points easily maybe more. 19 points would take them up to 5th 1 point behind Champions League.

I've recently decided to consistently watch football from  every member of the top 5 leagues. I want to choose a club in each country that suits my favorite playstyle.

I am a huge fan of possession dominance, strict formation and disciplined, simple playing (like Kroos) players playstyle. Somewhat like the 2014 German national team, which was super satisfying to watch.

So why not go for big Sam (Sam Allardyce) surely there is no better candidate to give Newcastle the best opportunity to stay in PL and he has already said he now considers himself a 'short term manager' so 18 month deal then get who you want to the next level",PremierLeague,1636222485

United Lacking Creativity,Bruno has not been that creative this season. Why not give more freedom to van de Beek &amp; Sancho rather than going for the same old? Sancho has not been too promising but he can adjust in a better position. What do you guys think? Should they start or remain at the bench?,PremierLeague,1636208156
"Manchester United have settled for mediocrity, and Ole is living proof of that.","I’ve recently heard a lot of talk about how the board of Manchester United lack any ambition of genuine success, and I think this is perfectly encapsulated through Ole. He represents safety, security, someone who is placid and won’t rock the boat, boring. Keeping Ole is an admission of mediocrity, as United will never be able to truly contend with the current football super powers, both in England and abroad, while he is there. He will never represent the winning mentality, culture, and simple talent of a Klopp, Guardiola, Tuchel. He’s safe, harmless,but maybe that’s just what Manchester United are now? Either United fans need to adjust their expectations (which will never happen) or a serious upheaval is needed within that club.",PremierLeague,1636206844
Dean Smith might be the worst manager in the prem right now,"I've been following Aston Villa this season due to the exciting new signings, and somehow they're not doing really well. Buendia looks out of place, Bailey barely plays and Ings (who's probably performing the best of the three) doesn't look like the same guy who was leading Soton just a couple of years ago.

Now, I'm the first one to say a manager isn't always the only one to blame, but honestly Villa looks like they have no plan or strategy before the match, they have great players who are out there looking like a league 1 side, there's no way almost all of them are in arguably the lowest points in their career with nobody to blame for it.

"Anyone else annoyed by the term ""3 AT THE BACK"" when it's clearly 5?","For example, Manchester United playing with 3 center BACKS, and 2 wing BACKS (who are clearly defenders by trade) is a very defensive formation... that literally is employing 5 defenders. Why do announcers call it 3 at the back when it's clearly 5 at the back, lined up in a 5-3-2?

I understand other teams might play more of a 3-4-3 or go out players who are more wingers (attackers) than wing backs (defenders), but can't these pundits/announcers differentiate the two from game to game and team to team?

"Premier league club fans that say their club is run like a business, is that not all of us?","Looking for some education on this topic because really I'm only interested in watching the games and accepting whatever the owners are willing to invest.

I hear it from Spurs and Manchester United fans a lot in particular, it seems to only depend on whether the team is doing well or not.

For example as a Liverpool fan if we were finishing 7th and not winning anything the anti FSG sentiment would be much stronger, but because of their moneyball approach working, and the getting of good staff they manage to do well under a self sustaining model (I'll admit a lot of that is down to Klopp as well though).

I'm very likely to be wrong but it confuses me when as per the example above, Spurs keep their best (arguably) player, and the Glazers spend decently and bring in a lot of talent year after year, but they're bad owners?

**Southampton**

Since the victory over Leeds United half a month ago and got the first win of the season, the saints who regained their self-confidence have recently had a good performance. They have not only been unbeaten for several consecutive games, but also had a fierce battle to a penalty shoot out in the EFL with Chelsea, which almost led to a surprise. In the Premier League game last weekend, they won Watford 1-0 away. According to the data, the saints scored goals in the last five matches and two of them without concede, whose state seems to have improved greatly. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Aston Villa**

The overall combat effectiveness of Aston Villa has been significantly weakened compared with that of last season due to the loss of the core Grealish this season. Although the team has introduced strong players such as Ashley Young, Tuanzebe and Ings to make up for the lineup, the effect is not very ideal at present. Especially recently, the team have suffered a wave of four consecutive defeats. The last round was also slaughtered by West Ham United 0-4 at home, and the central defender Konsa received the red card. It is afraid that Villa's morale has been greatly eroded.

In terms of state, Villa is currently at the lowest point, while Southampton has gradually come out of the trouble. The saints naturally have more confidence to win this encounter for the advantage of home. At the same time, Southampton's record in the historical battle with Villa is also dominant. They have only lost once against Willa over the year. So Southampton is still trustworthy in this battle.",PremierLeague,1636104716

TAA is no where near being the best RB in the league,"He is a good player but I think people are for some reason deeming his qualities (passing, crossing and set pieces) those to be what qualifies a right back when it isn’t. If you are asking me is he a good RIGHT BACK taking into consideration what being a right back entails then he absolutely is not.

He is woeful defensively and that got proven last season when Liverpools defence was riddled with injuries and he had no cover from world class centre backs beside him. I think as a right mid or right wing back then he belongs in the conversation but not as a full back. James, AWB, Lamptey and Walker would be on my list ahead of him as a more complete RB",PremierLeague,1636072025

Nothing that really needs to be said,"if you’re a football fan and you think that any right back in the league is better than Trent Alexander Arnold you’re an idiot.

I’m talking about football ability in general Sure AWB Cancelo James are all better defensively but when it comes down to it who’s better at playing football. He will also obviously improve defensively as he grows up. I’m sick of this debate IDC that AWB can slide tackle Trent is clear on terms of a footballing ability.

"Goal of the month, the best goal will not win.","Last month we saw Mo Salah have player of the month robbed from him as Ronaldo fan-boys swarmed to vote for their idol, regardless of the fact that Mo had the same amount of goals and didn't lose a game.

Then this month there's some fantastic goals;

*Mo Salah individual brilliance vs Man City.
*Mo Salah &lt;See above but against Watford&gt; 
*Mason Greenwood long range rocket vs Leicester.
*Tielemans lovely looped finish in the same game.
*Callum Wilson's acrobatic over-the-head shot vs Palace.
*Tielemans again with a outside the box smasher on the first touch vs Leicester.
And 
*Ronaldos volley finish vs Tottenham. Which was a good finish I'm not going to deny, but mainly down to Fernandes's great pass.

Is Ronaldos goal good? Yes it is. Is it the best of this selection? Not even close. Is he probably going to win it anyway? Mark my words he will!

An example, would be James Ward-Prowse. Not usually involved in debates and not talked about much in discussions for the England squad, best midfielders in the league etc, so is underrated in that sense.

"Why do clubs spend money on players for the u-23 team who will never play for the first team, what is the value in having a good u-23 team?","There’s plenty of players earning in excess of £100,000 playing u-23 football who get loaned out to league 2 sides and ride the bench despite being 22 and trained at Arsenal or Tottenham. Surely they’re not good players or they would play for the likes of Carlisle or Raith Rovers. 

I know of one guy, MTC, used to play for Chelsea academy, joined Fulham u-23’s and earned £98,000 a year for 2 years, he went on loan to Colchester and they sent him back in 2 weeks, not even worth it for Colchester to have him without paying his wages. He now sits on the bench for non league Weymouth. Why the fuck was he paid to be an u-23 player for 2 years? Over £200k on a gamble? Surely there’s big losses with little return of any with these squads. He’s not even the biggest one, but spending millions on rubbish u-23 players seems so pointless. Anyone who’s good seemingly goes from u-18 to first team, or at least plays when they go on loan to lower league teams. 

Another lad released by Spurs was signed by Arsenal, now at 21, he sits on the bench for Carlisle at the bottom of league 2. Dinzeyi

Conte has signed for Tottenham. Man U fans; would you rather have lost at the weekend?,"The game at the weekend between these two teams was dubbed 'El Sackico' and it didn't disappoint with Nuno being sacked a few days later with the record for Shortest tenure (124 days) for a Tottenham manager who wasn't a caretaker.

However now Spurs have confirmed the signing of Conte who was also hotly discussed for the United job if Ole was to be sacked, it feels personally that although Man U won the 3rd points (really quite easily too), Tottenham are the real winners by getting to the quality manager first.

So Manchester United fans, would you rather have lost at the weekend if it would have guaranteed you getting Conte over Ole?",PremierLeague,1635856838

Mexican League Point System If Superleague were to go through?,"I LOVE watching the mexican league, mainly because of their point system. Not only is every season a surprise, just like the Prem, the way the champion is crowned is very interesting. Although the super league will never go through, hypothetically speaking, if it did, i would love to have seen the prem switch over to the mexican league point system. Pretty much at the end of the season, top 4 automatically qualify to “playoffs”, 5-12 play each other in a mini knockout, in the top to bottom format (aka 5th plays 12th, 6th plays 11th, 7th plays 10th, and 8th plays 9th) in 1 single game, where the higher placed team gets home advantage. Once the games are played between 5-12, the 4 winners go on to play against the top 4 teams that automatically qualified. (In the same order, top to bottom format depending on who won) and then you are left with quarters, semis, and then final, with the winner winning the league. Since mexican teams don’t really have a big tournament to qualify to, this system works, so if the superleague had gone through, this would be a solid way to even it out for other teams in the prem in my opinion.",PremierLeague,1635731805

On a Macro level the Wages are ruining Players,"The Wages are absurd at the moment and I think there needs to be a ceiling or cap put in place. 

Players now are only playing for clubs that suit them, theyre following the money and the fame and they dont want to actually be there and it shows.

Before a player would grow up wanting to play for a team, and would have posters on their walls as a kid and want to play for the club and the fans and the money was a subsequent matter. They would often stay at a club for life and that was their club and their entire life revolved around the success orlf that club.

Nowadays they do not have this support or drive or will to be at a club. They want to do a few seasons in the sun and take a few pics for instagram and then maybe their girlfriend wants to live in Paris so they ask their manager for a move and then they start a clothing line in London so head there for a spell but they dont like the rain so 2 years later they head for spain. 

Its a complete joke and you can see the lack of commitment and desire in their performances. Theyre in it for fame and money now and the club and the team are subsequent facts. 

If there was a wage cap introduced across Europe, whereby every club paid everyone the same amount, increasing with years played for the club and then back to the starting wage if they move to a new club. It would seperate the men from the boys. We would then see who really wants to be there and who doesnt.",PremierLeague,1635705456
What’s happened to Todd Cantwell?,"Wasn’t he like...literally their best player lol. I seem to remember loads of clubs wanted him when they went down. He stayed, helped them come up and now...well idk. 

Overheard on talksport earlier today he hasnt been in the squad for a while. What’s happened there?",PremierLeague,1635704848
Could this Norwich squad be even worse than Derby's 2007-08 season?,"We're only 10 games in, but this Norwich squad is already looking like it could be an all-time worst Premier League club of all time. They've only scored 3 goals, none away. It was only until their most recent match for someone other than Teemu Pukki to score. They even looked completely terrible against bottom-feeding squads Watford, Burnely, and most recently Leeds. And those squads, unlike Norwich, actually have some semblance of goal-scoring.

So the big question is: how bad can it get? 2007-08 Derby bad? Or can they squeak out enough wins to avoid being not only the worst Premier League team of all time but also the worst Big 5 league club of all time?",PremierLeague,1635701037

How can a club consistently be good enough to be promoted and be bad enough to be relegated the following season?,I’m not picking on Norwich. They’re certainly not the only club to fit this pattern. And I don’t expect a newly promoted club to end up in the top five. It seems as though there have been a lot of “one and done“ (two if they’re lucky) seasons over the last ten or fifteen years.,PremierLeague,1635697756

Who is the 4th Best Manager in the Premier League?,"Given that Guardiola Klopp and Tuchel are seen by most fans as the top 3 managers in the league for the trophies they have won and the way they have transformed their sides, I was wondering as a light hearted question who people thought was the best manager of the rest?

The shortlist of managers I have come up with are:

Brendan Rodgers: Known for building attractive, yet pragmatic possession based teams, notable achievements have been:

Winning promotion to the Premier league for Swansea before finishing 11th in their debut PL season

Taking Liverpool to 2nd place in 2013/14, their highest finish since 2008/09

Winning two trebles in two full seasons at Celtic, including an undefeated domestic season in his first year

Having two consecutive 5th placed seasons with Leicester, as well as winning an FA Cup

Rafa Benitez: Known for building pragmatic defensively solid teams, whilst often not having massive budgets, notable achievements include:

Winning two La Liga titles and a UEFA Cup for Valencia 

Winning the Champions league and Fa Cup for Liverpool, as well as reaching another UCL Final and coming 2nd in 2008/09

Winning promotion to the La Liga with Tenerife, winning the Europa League with Chelsea in 2013, winning the Coppa Italia and Italian Supercup with Napoli and consolidating Newcastle in the Premier League after winning the Championship, despite working with a small budget compared to other Premier League teams.

David Moyes: Also known for building pragmatic defensively solid teams, notable achievements include:

A successful 11 years at Everton, where Moyes consistently finished between 5th-8th, even making the UCL in 2004/05, as well as being FA Cup runners up in 2008/09.

Taking a relegation threatened West Ham to 6th place and Europa League Qualification in a year and a half, their best finish since 1998/99.

Graham Potter: Known for building attractive, possession based teams with not much money to work on, notable achievements have been:

Winning three promotions and the Swedish Cup at Ostersund, hence qualifying for the Europa League

Taking Swansea to the Fa Cup Quarter Finals and 10th in the Championship, despite losing several key players the season before.

Transforming Brighton from a pragmatic and cautious defensive team into a possession oriented side, coming  15th and 16th and currently sitting 7th in his first three seasons

Claudio Ranieri: Known for building compact and organised defensive sides, whilst also being tactically flexible, notable achievements are:

Winning the Premier League for Leicester at 5000-1 odds, winning Fifa coach of the year in 2016 for this achievement 

Coming 2nd with Chelsea and making the UCL Semis in 2003/04

Taking Cagliari up from Serie C1 to Serie A from 1988-1990

Winning the Coppa Italia and Italian Supercup with Fiorentina

Overall I would probably say Ranieri has had the best career so far due to the Premier League title win, but if I had to appoint a new manager at a club right now I would probably select Benitez or Rodgers due to their success at a wide range of clubs.",PremierLeague,1635640818

I’ve always had faith we’d get top 4 this season even after the bad start &amp; just because we’ve got no Europa (Thursday curse) to worry about. I just want the thoughts of other teams fans now after 10games? The whole league has improved drastically I feel, Brentford have impressed in particularly(apart from a bad day in the office today). Apart from Norwich, everybody else should be competing (Ranieri at Watford, expecting Newcastle spend big in January) Most games are really competitive to a certain extent.

I used numbers to find out if the 21/22 season is the toughest in the Premier League's history.,"**TLDR:** It is. By quite the margin.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, I have to mention [this balon video, comparing the difficulty between the UEFA and European Cup throughout the years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-P-xCSI47HQ). Balón is my favourite football youtube channel and this video inspired my post. I highly recommend supporting Fahad through [his patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/balon), so he can continue to create his amazing content.

&amp;#x200B;

Onto the numbers...

Specifically Elo ratings, which is what I used to calculate my data, I'm not going to try to explain Elo ratings (because I'd most certainly butcher it) but [this website](http://clubelo.com/System) is where I sourced all of the numbers for today's post and they've a great explanation on there of how a team's Elo score is calculated. Essentially, the higher the score, the better the team.

&amp;#x200B;

Even before we get into the main part of this post, Elo ratings can give us some interesting about previous title wins, such as:

&amp;#x200B;

**The 5 Weakest Ever Eventual Champions**

||Season|Champions|Elo rating at start of season|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**1st**|**15/16**|**Leicester**|**1634**|
|**2nd**|**97/98**|**Arsenal**|**1720**|
|**3rd**|**92/93**|**Man Utd**|**1773**|
|**4th**|**94/95**|**Blackburn**|**1776**|
|**5th**|**96/97**|**Man Utd**|**1789**|

**The 5 Strongest Ever Eventual Champions**

||Season|Champions|Elo rating at start of season|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**1st**|**19/20**|**Liverpool**|**2044**|
|**2nd**|**08/09**|**Man Utd**|**2026**|
|**Should Man City win the league this season, they will be 3rd**|**21/22**|**\*Man City**|**2009**|
|**3rd**|**09/10**|**Chelsea**|**1974**|
|**4th**|**18/19**|**Man City**|**1971**|
|**5th**|**20/21**|**Man City**|**1963**|

(as a Liverpool fan, it pains me that we had such great seasons in 08/09 and 18/19 at the same time Man Utd and Man City had literal all-time great seasons, if not for them we'd have 2 more titles to our name)

&amp;#x200B;

So, how do we judge how difficult any given season in the premier league is? And, how do we prove that the 21/22 season is the toughest? Not only that, but which league title win is actually the most impressive when both the quality of the league AND the quality of the champions is taken into account?

Here's how I attempted to do so:

**League Difficulty = Strength of the Premier League x Strength of the Premier League in comparison to the strongest leagues in Europe**

or

**LD = Average Premier League team Elo score x The Premier League's Elo score weight**

The Premier League's Elo score weight  = Average Premier League team Elo score ÷ Total Elo score of each top 8 leagues in Europe)

&amp;#x200B;

I applied the formula to every premier league season since 92/93, and found...

&amp;#x200B;

**The 5 ""Easiest"" Premier League Seasons (Lowest LD Score)**

&amp;#x200B;

||Season|Champions|League Difficulty|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**1st**|**97/98**|**Arsenal**|**201.03**|
|**2nd**|**96/97**|**Man Utd**|**201.77**|
|**3rd**|**93/94**|**Man Utd**|**208.48**|
|**4th**|**98/99**|**Man Utd**|**212.47**|
|**5th**|**99/00**|**Man Utd**|**212.62**|

&amp;#x200B;

**The 5 ""Toughest"" Premier League Seasons (Highest LD Score)**

&amp;#x200B;

||Season|Champions|League Difficulty|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**1st**|**21/22**|**TBD**|**246.27**|
|**2nd**|**19/20**|**Liverpool**|**240.34**|
|**3rd**|**08/09**|**Man Utd**|**238.19**|
|**4th**|**20/21**|**Man City**|**233.11**|
|**5th**|**07/08**|**Man Utd**|**229.72**|

&amp;#x200B;

There it is, the 21/22 season has the highest quality of any season in history (according to the Elo system) But which title win is the most impressive? How do we judge the difficulty in wining the title for each previous champion?

Here's how I did it:

&amp;#x200B;

**Champion's Difficulty = League Difficulty x (3000 - Champion's Elo score at the start of the season)**

By subtracting the eventual champion's Elo from 3000 (chosen because Elo scores rarely exceed 2100), teams with a lower Elo score will be rewarded for overachieving.

Here's what I found:

&amp;#x200B;

**The 5 ""Easiest"" Title Wins (The Expected Team Won)**

||Season|Champions|Champion's Difficulty|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**1st**|**19/20**|**Liverpool**|**229760.87**|
|**2nd**|**08/09**|**Man Utd**|**232001.26**|
|**3rd**|**18/19**|**Man City**|**234888.39**|
|**4th**|**09/10**|**Chelsea**|**235159.7**|
|**5th**|**05/06**|**Chelsea**|**235226.73**|

&amp;#x200B;

**The 5 ""Toughest"" Title Wins (Biggest Upsets)**

||Season|Champions|Champion's Difficulty|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**1st**|15/16|Leicester|299133.87|
|**2nd**|16/17|Chelsea|272441.23|
|**3rd**|92/93|Man Utd|270404.52|
|**4th**|94/95|Blackburn|268444.95|
|**5th**|01/02|Arsenal|266317.62|

&amp;#x200B;

**Hoping you find all this as interesting as I do, I had fun making this. I'll post the full table of results in the comments below including where Chelsea and Liverpool would rank if they were to win the league this year. I didn't mention it in the post but compiling the Elo scores of each of the top 8 leagues in Europe had some interesting results too (never realised how the Russian league become basically the 6th best league in the world there for a stretch in 00s/10s), I can post that table below also. All of this isn't meant to be fact, Elo scores, like every other ranking system has its problems, but I like them and enjoy using them in posts like this.**

How competitive is the EPL across the entire division?,"It is stated that the Premier League is the most competitive in Europe. See this analysis for example but you can find others.

[https://runrepeat.com/most-competitive-soccer-leagues-in-europe-analysis](https://runrepeat.com/most-competitive-soccer-leagues-in-europe-analysis)

I think this analysis is biased as it looks mostly at the top end and not the entire division. For me, the EPL has become less competitive (across the entire division) in the last decade. What you think?

Currently, only five teams have a goal difference better than +1! They are the top four and Brentford. Each year I see the EPL get a little more unbalanced between the best and the rest. I realize the top has become more competitive this year, but I mean across the entire division and over the past decade. The current goal difference is not the only evidence.

&amp;#x200B;

* You can stay up with far fewer points now. They used to say 40, but last year 30 would have kept you up. This year I think it will as well.
* You used to have a really good shot at the title in the low 80 point range. Now you often need to push towards 100. Few teams can get to 100.
* A small positive goal difference, say above +1, can get you close to Europe or in Europe some years (18 - 19 Wolves, for example).
* The top teams get goal differences of +70 and even +80 now, but you do not have to go far back to find champions in the +30 to +40 range.
* It seems that good players outside the ""big"" teams are now just talked about as what ""big"" team they will end up at. Think Rice. I mean, West Ham have are in-and-around the top four, are doing well in Europe, are quite rich, located in London, have a huge new high capacity stadium, have a rich history and all that, but still, it is assumed by all pundits that Rice will end up at UTD, City, or Chelsea at some point. This one is anecdotal.
* The 5,6,7 to nil scorelines seem to be becoming more common. This one is anecdotal.

"Club Legends as Managers, a Blessing or a Curse?","We have seen in recent times, clubs making a legend their current manager, we saw Lampard with Chelsea, Pirlo with Juve, Madrid with Zidane, Barcelona with Koeman and Manchester United with Ole.

In recent times, we have seen Chelsea relieve Lampard of his duties because he's not putting the club where they ought to be, Juventus replaced Pirlo after they qualified for the champions league on the last day as opposed to winning the title and with Barcelona recently sacking the man that landed their first Champions League title, then we have Manchester United staying through thick and thin with Ole Gunnar Solskjær.

We can all but agree that Ole has regressed with the current Manchester United squad as it looks like the best squad post Fergie, my problem is why the board still back Ole Gunnar as it appears to be out of luck with Manchester United.

I think Ten Haag, Luis Enrique, Zidane or Conte will do wonders with this current Manchester United squad.

Does the board think they owe it to Solskjær because he sealed our first treble, or they think he can pull it off with Klopp did with Liverpool or do we blame this on the glazers for being carefree?",PremierLeague,1635415422

Have goals outside the box declined in the EPL since the game has become more tactical/modernized?,"I've been watching the game for many years and comparing now to back then I feel like most teams in the top half of the table take less chances outside the box compared to years ago and try to walk the ball into the net, my team is a prime example Manchester City. 

An example: Watching Kevin De Bruyne when he was at Wolfsburg the guy was a pure goal machine, he could score from anywhere given half a chance, freekicks, long distance you name it, but now he's reduced to being an excellent assist machine with the odd goal every now and then, he rarely takes shots outside the box when he has the chance and even if he does his conversion rate Is nowhere near when he was playing for Wolfsburg. I understand he's playing in a new system with Pep but I believe all skills are important to your game and I'm just disappointed that that part of his game has diminished.

I don't know if I'm letting my emotions get the best of me but I truly feel like we had more freedom on the pitch years ago which resulted in a lot more spectacular and exciting moments compared to now. 

Gerrard with a 30 yard screamer volley against Man City, Rooney derby day Bicycle, Balotelli ""Why Always Me"" &amp; an unforgettable favorite of mines New Castle's Papiss Cissé with an alien like bender from outside the box against Chelsea, and so many more. 

I miss exciting players that played how they want to play, players like Ronaldinho, Carlos Tevez, Drogba, Torres etc, some players right now which make football exciting for me is Allan Saint-Maximin, Salah, Foden, Bernardo Silva...Lord Fred.

Got a off topic there but what do you guys think? Have goals outside the box been reduced? Is it because the league is a lot more different tactically or is it because players have less freedom or skill, or is it a combination of everything.",PremierLeague,1635379812

Why did Pogba get a red card against Liverpool,"
I know it may seem as an obvious answer but I played football yesterday with a bunch of random people and someone tackled a player in the same way Pogba did but touched the ball before the foot unlike Pogba which was more like both at the same time. Then, the person who got tackled told us it should have been a foul on him, not because there was contact but because according to him, there is a law in football that states that players aren’t allowed to tackle with the sole of their feet, the exact same way Pogba did. He also said that Pogba would have gotten booked regardless if he touched the foot Keita before, at the same time, or after touching the ball.
I’ve watched football since a very long time and never heard of it but this guy swore that this rule exists so I just wanted to ask in order to be sure.",PremierLeague,1635301559

Has Ole steadied the ship?,"This is something I keep seeing said in Ole’s defence recently and I just don’t get it. Man Utd fans seem to think he’s turned the team around from relegation fodder, but I just don’t see the progress he’s supposedly made. He hasn’t won any trophies - Mourinho and LVG did, and his highest league finish is as high as Mourinho’s but with five less points. Granted Mourinho was further behind Man City but I don’t think we can credit Ole for Man City finishing with 14 less points than a few years before. 

The only thing I can think of that’s improved under Ole is the squad on paper, but are we seriously saying that Maguire, Wan Bissaka etc wouldn’t have signed for Mourinho, LVG or Moyes? Seems a stretch. I’d also argue that makes Ole’s record even worse as he’s achieving less with more.

Anyone else think that it isn't always the managers fault that a team goes on a bad run of games? Personally I think the players should be held equally accountable,,PremierLeague,1635185013

Manchester United's main problem - it's not the coach.,"Right now the main problem is Ronaldo.

Here's the pattern.  A few years ago,  everyone was excited about talent coming along, like Martial, Lingard and Rashford. What does the team do? Bring in the aging Ibrahimovic for fire power. More recently,  Cavani has been a highly temporary star for them.  
Sure, bring in the aging superstar for mentoring and bench relief,  and maybe Ronaldo is not ready for that yet.  

Manchester United has a pattern of developing amazing new talent,  but then not bringing them to the next level because of irregular playing time. 
They shouldn't have Ronaldo up front.  It should be Fernandes. Fernandes looks like he's doing a slow,  frustrated burn right now.
Ride with the younger talent,  maybe place 4th or 5th, and look at top place in a couple of years. 
If they had EVER done that, they'd be a top contender now.  But they haven't.",PremierLeague,1635178902

Manchester City beat United without even playing them,"Manchester City have managed to cripple their main competition from last season without spending a penny.

By showing interest in signing Cristiano Ronaldo, City provoked United into re-signing their once talisman; simply so their inter-city rivals couldn't. 

In doing so, Manchester United have thrown away all progress they were building towards in the last two years, discarding all plans to accommodate CR7. This act of emotion over logic is a catastrophic failure by Manchester United.

The signing has resulted in a catastrophic drop in form;

Last season United finished 2nd with 74 points, they are projected on form so far this season to finish on 59.

Personally I don't believe for a moment that Manchester City and Pep were realistically considering bringing in a nearly 37 has-been for record premier-league wages.",PremierLeague,1635175927
