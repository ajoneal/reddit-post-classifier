       "Last month we saw Mo Salah have player of the month robbed from him as Ronaldo fan-boys swarmed to vote for their idol, regardless of the fact that Mo had the same amount of goals and didn't lose a game.\\n\\nThen this month there's some fantastic goals;\\n\\n*Mo Salah individual brilliance vs Man City.\\n*Mo Salah &lt;See above but against Watford&gt; \\n*Mason Greenwood long range rocket vs Leicester.\\n*Tielemans lovely looped finish in the same game.\\n*Callum Wilson's acrobatic over-the-head shot vs Palace.\\n*Tielemans again with a outside the box smasher on the first touch vs Leicester.\\nAnd \\n*Ronaldos volley finish vs Tottenham. Which was a good finish I'm not going to deny, but mainly down to Fernandes's great pass.\\n\\nIs Ronaldos goal good? Yes it is. Is it the best of this selection? Not even close. Is he probably going to win it anyway? Mark my words he will!\\n\\nPersonally I think Callum Wilson's finish takes the cake.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1\n",

       " \\n\\nA mere 298 days had passed between Claudio Ranieriâ€™s Leicester spectacularly winning the [Premier League](https://www.statista.com/topics/1773/premier-league/) and the aforementioned manager being sacked by the club he had brought such unexpected glory. Elite football management is a cut-throat business.\\n\\nAs this infographic shows though, the Foxes arenâ€™t the most ruthless club in the league when it comes to showing managers the door. Of the current top-flight teams that have played in the Premier League for at least ten seasons, Crystal Palace have spent the average shortest amount of time with each of their managers â€“ 450 days.\\n\\nThe shortest tenure at the South London club was that of Frank de Boer. His ill-fated stint lasted just 77 days after Palace failed to score a single goal in his four league games in charge. In fairness, de Boer was replaced by Roy Hodgson who went on to lead the side for 1,350 days before making the decision himself to call an end to his time as bossâ€“ a rare luxury for a Premier League manager â€“ saying: \"The time is right to step away from the rigours of top-flight Premier League football.\"\\n\\nThe other end of the scale is somewhat skewed by two legends of the dugout â€“ ArsÃ¨ne Wenger at [Arsenal](https://www.statista.com/study/65916/arsenal-football-club/) and Sir Alex Ferguson at [Manchester United](https://www.statista.com/topics/2376/manchester-united/). Combined, the two spent 17,598 days at their respective clubs. After periods of such stability often come turbulent times though, and for United especially, this has been the case. Calculating for the post-Ferguson era, Unitedâ€™s average would be just 749 days. Arsenalâ€™s first attempt at replacing Wenger â€“ Unai Emery - was ended after 555 days, while Mikel Arteta is still in charge after 687.\\n\\nAfter just 11 games this season, 5 clubs have already parted ways with their manager and chances are thereâ€™s at least one more club with a drafted press release containing the phrase: â€œWe would like to thank &lt;insert managerâ€™s name&gt; for his dedication and hard work.\"\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n \\n\\nSource:[https://www.statista.com/chart/26150/shelf-life-expectancy-premier-league-managers/](https://www.statista.com/chart/26150/shelf-life-expectancy-premier-league-managers/)\\n\\n \\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sc2whezw6rz71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fb27ca8fe07129a1104cf2df6f1376d35f606ba      1\n",
       "Not only Ronaldo, but De Gea as well. The defense is abysmal, the coaching is embarrassing, and if it wasn't for Ronaldo this team should have 3+ more losses. \\n\\nI watch most every United game because I used to be a huge fan back in the day (Berbatov, Rooney, Nani, teams) and the class this team used to have just isn't there. \\n\\nIts a combination of coaching and personnel right? How can they turn this around? I just love futbol and I want the most revered teams to be at their rightful place at the top for most drama and excitement. \\n\\nI know the coach wasn't at fault for the own goal and missed assignment against City, but when you look at the possession #'s and shots on goal.. its almost like they are inviting City to score. City feels like they are on another level, so its a bad comparison, but something has got to change with United.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",
