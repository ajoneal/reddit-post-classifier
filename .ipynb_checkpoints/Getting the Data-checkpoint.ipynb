       "A bit of a confusing question. Basically a player that you can look at from 2 different perspectives and think he's both underrated (not talked about enough) and overrated (perceived quality is better than he actually is) at the same time.\\n\\nAn example, would be James Ward-Prowse. Not usually involved in debates and not talked about much in discussions for the England squad, best midfielders in the league etc, so is underrated in that sense. But because of a few of his free-kicks from a while back, I just assume he's a pretty good player, but is he as good as I think he is? Therefore overrated in that sense.\\n\\nWould be interesting to see how people approach this.      1\n",
